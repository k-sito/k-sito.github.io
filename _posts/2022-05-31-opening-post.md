# Opening Post

If you had told me at any point in my life up until a few years ago that I'd be spending a solid 8+ years living in Southern Texas and starting my own blog for fun in a github project of all places, I would have had an easier time believing that Tropicana was working on creating a cereal designed to be eaten with orange juice instead of milk (which did indeed happen a few months ago).

I'd be hesitant to believe that I have anything to write about that people would actually be interested in reading on a regular basis so as of today, Tuesday, May 31st, 2022, if this blog receives 0 views (except my very gracious friends who are probably reading this to humor meâ€¦thanks guys) and I end up looking back on this project 5 years from now and cringing at myself, I'll at least have the satisfaction in knowing that I gave it a shot. It'll also maybe alleviate my friends from having to listen to my consistent and random ramblings.

Anyways, here's to happy ramblings and katie konsiderations!
